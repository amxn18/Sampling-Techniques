echo "--------------------------------------"
echo "This project demonstrates 4 sampling methods using a synthetic dataset:"
echo "Dataset contains 100 people with:"
echo "- ID"
echo "- Age"
echo "- Gender"
echo "- Income
echo "- Region"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Techniques Implemented:"
echo "---------------------------"

echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Random Sampling (simple_random_sampling.py)"
echo "- Randomly picks rows from the dataset."
echo "- Pros  : Easy, unbiased if sample size is large"
echo "- Cons  : May miss important sub-groups"
echo ""

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Systematic Sampling (systematic_sampling.py)"
echo "- Picks every k-th row after a random start."
echo "- Pros  : Simple to apply"
echo "- Cons  : Can be biased if there's a pattern"
echo ""

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Stratified Sampling (stratified_sampling.py)"
echo "- Divides data into strata (e.g., Income) and samples from each."
echo "- Pros  : Ensures all groups are represented"
echo "- Cons  : Requires clear group definitions"
echo ""

echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster Sampling (cluster_sampling.py)"
echo "- Randomly selects whole groups (e.g., departments)."
echo "- Pros  : Cost-effective"
echo "- Cons  : Higher error, may miss variability"
echo ""

echo "üì¶ How to Run:"
echo "-------------"

echo "Run using:"
echo "  python simple_random_sampling.py"
echo "  python systematic_sampling.py"
echo "  python stratified_sampling.py"
